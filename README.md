# IDS
This repository contains a super advanced Intrusion Detection System (IDS) implemented in Bash script. The IDS provides comprehensive monitoring and detection capabilities for file system changes, utilizing various advanced techniques and tools.

Key Features:

Machine Learning Integration: Placeholder for future integration with ML models for anomaly detection.
Distributed Monitoring with SSH: Monitors directories on remote systems.
Advanced Log Analysis with ELK Stack: Sends logs to an Elasticsearch cluster for analysis and visualization in Kibana.
RBAC with LDAP Integration: Secure access control using LDAP.
Dynamic Configuration Reloading: Allows changing configurations without restarting the IDS.
Encrypted Configuration Storage: Securely stores configurations using OpenSSL.
Multi-threading with GNU Parallel: Efficiently processes large tasks.
Backup and Restore Mechanisms: Securely backs up and restores baselines and logs.
Database Integration for Alert Management: Uses a SQL database to manage alerts and logs.
REST API for Real-Time Alerts and Management: Provides an interface for real-time management and alerts.
Usage Instructions:

Initialize the Database
Create a Baseline
Check for Changes
Run as a Daemon
Real-time Monitoring
Generate a Report
Reload Configuration
